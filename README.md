# support-vector-machines
Educational SVM implementations from scratch without sklearn. CVXOPT is used as the equation solver.

For binary classifiers, the labels should be [-1, 1].  
multi_SVM.py is a multiclass SVM using the OneVsRest strategy.  
custom kernels are supported, linear and rbf kernels are implemented.
